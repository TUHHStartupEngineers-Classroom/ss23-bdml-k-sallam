Another free program is [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com), that provides a nice graphic interface for R. Download R first, then download R-studio. Both can run on PCs, Macs or Linux. Students will be learning R in the stats labs using the lab manual []().\n\n## Additional R resources\n\n1. Google is great, Google your problem\n2. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is great, google will often take you there because someone has already asked your question, and someone else has answered, usually many people have answered your question many ways.\n3. ---"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["lightbox"],"highlight-style":"a11y-dark","output-file":"06_links.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","lightbox":"auto","theme":{"dark":"darkly","light":"flatly"},"title":"Links","author":"Joschka Schwarz"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
